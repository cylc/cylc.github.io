												workflow composed of repeating tasks. Consequently:</p>
											 <ul>
													<li>Cylc can interleave cycles for fast catch-up from
													delays, and sustained high-throughput off the clock</li>
													<li> It seamlessly transitions between fast catch-up
													and clock-limited real-time scheduling</li>
													<li>It supports multiple cycles within a single
													workflow</li>

						<h3>Why Another Workflow Engine?</h3>

						<p><b>Production Ready:</b> 
						Cylc is not just a research tool. It has been used 24/7 for
						production weather forecasting since 2010.</p>
						<br/>

						<p><b>Efficient Cycling:</b>
						On its initial production deployment at NIWA Cylc cut ~24 hours
						of catch-up from delays down to ~30 minutes. Other systems
						could not do this! This is the original reason for Cylc's existence
						(Cylc also predates some current non-cycling systems).</p>
						<ul>
								<li> <i>ISO 8601 cycling</i> supports any date-time sequence
								for weather and climate workflows
								<li><i>integer cycling</i> supports arbitrary repetitive
								workflows (e.g. satellite data processing).
						</ul>
						<!--<p>If there is no cross-cycle dependence Cylc runs
						multiple cycles concurrently, limited only by external
						resource and configurable internal constraints.</p>-->
						<br/>

						<p><b>Open Source:</b> 
						Cylc is available on the GPLv3 license and is actively and openly
						<a href="https://github.com/cylc">developed on GitHub</a>.</p>
						<br/>

						<p><b>Distributed Architecture:</b> 
						Everything runs as the user, and only relies on the filesystem -
						there are no central workflow or database servers to manage. So
						Cylc has low admin overheads and a small security footprint.</p>
						<br/>

						<p><b>Distributed Workflows:</b> 
						Cylc easily manages task jobs on multiple remote hosts.</p>
						<br/>
						
						<p><b>Workflow Configuration:</b> 
						A human-readable config file, so modest workflows are easy to
						write, even for non-programmers. This is <b>not</b> <i>"just a
								static config file"</i> however: efficient programmatic
								generation of
				    large complex workflows is supported by task inheritance and
						parameterization, and Python-like general template processing. (A
						Python API is also planned for Cylc 9).</p>
						<br/>

						<p><b>Workflow Scaling:</b>
						Single workflows scale to thousands of tasks per cycle (however,
						Cylc is a distributed system so several smaller workflows may be
						preferred).</p>
						</br/>

						<p><b>System Scaling:</b>
						Cylc is built to transparently use a pool of host VMs, with
						load balancing at start-up, and it scales arbitrarily well with the
						number of host VMs. Running workflows can self-migrate to another
						host at maintenance time. </p> 
						<br/>

						<p><b>Powerful UIs:</b>
						GUIs for visualization and runtime monitoring and control
						(GTK desktop GUIs for cylc-7 - in production; web UI for Cylc 8 - 
						coming next year). The CLI can target many tasks at once, e.g. to
						re-trigger all failed tasks matching a certain pattern in
						particular cycle points.</p>
						<br/>

						<p><b>Flexibility and Generality:</b> Cylc can be used equally for
						every kind of workflow in climate, weather, and weather-driving
						forecasting (for example), in research, test, and production.
						Portable workflows are feasible that run "out of the box" in
						different environments; and even at different sites. This can lead
						to huge savings: transitioning complex systems from research to
						operations, for instance, is notoriously difficult if the workflows
						are different; and much worse again if conversion to a different
						workflow engine is required.</p> <br/>

						<p><b>HPC Batch Systems:</b>
						Cylc has great support for common HPC batch systems (workload
						managers) like PBS and Slurm. It can also manage plain background
						jobs on any Linux host or VM.</p>

						<p><b>Remote Job Hosts:</b>
						If you need to use ssh to reach a remote job host, Cylc supports
						that as well. This includes remote job query and kill, filesystem
						configuration and file installation, and job log retrieval. (Some
						of this is via Rose but soon to be built in to Cylc).</p>
						<br/>

						<p><b>Cross-workflow Triggering:</b>
						Via the upstream workflow database, so the upstream system doesn't
						have to be running.</p>
						<br/>

						<p><b>General External Triggering:</b>
						Trigger tasks off of anything in the external world - just supply a
						Python function that checks your external condition, and Cylc will
						call it repeatedly (and configurably) until satisfied.</p>
						<br/>

						<p><b>Resilience:</b>
						Cylc has many features to help deal with system problems, e.g.:</p>
						<ul>
								<li> configurable retries for both job submission and job
								execution
								<li> state checkpointing, with safe restarts even in the event
								of a power outage (Cylc even determines what happened to
								jobs orphaned during downtime)
								<li> polling to confirm that jobs are still queued or running
								as expected (if not, job status is updated accordingly)
								<li> manual job control: poll, kill, or retrigger jobs
								<li> failure (and other state) triggering - e.g. define tasks
								that only run if other tasks fail
								<li>flexible event handling - connect handler scripts to
								many events (such as task failure); and built-in email alerting
						</ul>
						<br/>

						<p><b>Other Capabilities in Brief:</b>
						</p>
						<ul>
								<li> Powerful web-based viewer for thousands of job logs
								<li> Validation - catch many errors prior to run time.
								<li> Edit Run - edit job scripts on the fly just before submission.
								<li> Broadcast task runtime settings (including environment variables) to
								tasks or groups of tasks, at runtime.
								<li> Simulation modes with proportional job run length.
								<li> Internal Queues to limit the number of concurrent active
								tasks.
								<li> Conditional triggering.
								<li> Clock-triggers - trigger off the clock as well as off other tasks.
								<li> External triggers - trigger off external events as well as
								other tasks - via user-defined Python plug-in functions.
								<li> Expiring tasks - optionally skip tasks that are too far
								behind the clock.
						</ul>
