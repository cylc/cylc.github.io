### Cylc (“silk”) is a workflow engine for cycling systems

Cylc was originally developed for operational environmental forecasting at NIWA by Dr Hilary Oliver - however it is not specialized to forecasting in any way. It is now an Open Source collaboration involving NIWA, Met Office, and others. It is available under the GPL v3 license.
