### Cylc users

Major sites known to be using Cylc are shown on the world map above. Sites are
shown in yellow, with

Note this is not an exhaustive list.

Many of these centers use Cylc with [Rose](https://github.com/metomi/rose), a
framework for managing and running meteorological suites.

[NCAS Computational Modelling Services](https://www.ncas.ac.uk/en/cms) supports
the use of Rose and Cylc on the UK national HPC facility
[ARCHER](http://www.archer.ac.uk) and the [JASMIN](http://www.jasmin.ac.uk)
data center, for users throughout the UK academic community.

[ARC Computational Modelling Systems](http://climate-cms.unsw.wikispaces.net/)
supports use of Rose and Cylc with the Unified Model in the Australian academic
community.
